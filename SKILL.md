# PocketBase Development Skill

Guide for working with PocketBase as a backend, with specialized focus on the two most error-prone areas: API Rules (permissions) and JavaScript Event Hooks.

## Core Workflow

1. **Define schema** - Create collections with appropriate fields
2. **Set API rules** - Configure permissions (listRule, viewRule, createRule, updateRule, deleteRule)
3. **Implement hooks** - Add server-side logic in `pb_hooks/` directory
4. **Test thoroughly** - Verify permissions and hooks trigger correctly

## Production Security (CRITICAL)

**⚠️ These are ESSENTIAL for production deployments - not optional:**

### 1. Encrypt Settings
By default, PocketBase stores SMTP passwords and S3 credentials as **PLAIN TEXT** in the database.
- Enable encryption: Settings > Application > "Encrypt settings"
- Do this BEFORE entering production credentials

### 2. Enable Rate Limiting
PocketBase v0.23+ includes built-in rate limiting to prevent abuse and DoS attacks.
- Configure: Dashboard > Settings > Application
- Prevents excessive auth requests, record creation spam
- Can use reverse proxy rate limiting for advanced needs

### 3. Protect Admin Endpoints
Use reverse proxy (nginx/caddy) to whitelist IPs for `/api/admins/*` endpoints.

### 4. Enable Superuser MFA
Add MFA to `_superusers` collection for additional security layer.
- Requires one-time password (email code) for superuser auth
- Settings > Collections > _superusers > Options

### 5. Use HTTPS
PocketBase supports auto-managed TLS with Let's Encrypt:
```bash
./pocketbase serve --https example.com:443
```
Or use reverse proxy (nginx, caddy) for more complex setups.

### 6. Regular Backups
Backup entire `pb_data` directory regularly (see references/production_checklist.md).

**Never expose PocketBase directly to internet without these protections!**

## API Rules (Permissions)

### Critical Concepts

**Rules act as BOTH authorization AND filters:**
- Empty string `""` = locked (superuser only)
- `null` = public access (no restrictions)
- Non-empty expression = conditional access

**Return codes based on rule type:**
- Unsatisfied `listRule` → 200 with empty array
- Unsatisfied `createRule` → 400
- Unsatisfied `viewRule`, `updateRule`, `deleteRule` → 404
- Locked rule with non-superuser → 403

**Superusers bypass ALL rules** - use test accounts for rule validation

### Common Permission Patterns

See [references/permission_patterns.md](references/permission_patterns.md) for detailed examples.

**Key points:**
- Use `@request.auth.id != ""` to require authentication
- Use `@request.auth.id = id` for owner-only access
- Use `@request.body.fieldName` to validate submitted data
- Use `:isset` modifier to check if field was submitted
- Use `:length` modifier for array field item counts
- Chain conditions with `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR)

### Permission Debugging

When permissions fail unexpectedly:
1. Check if testing as superuser (rules are bypassed!)
2. Verify `@request.auth` is populated (user is authenticated)
3. Test rule expression in isolation
4. Check for typos in field names
5. Remember: `@request.body.*` for submitted data, not `@request.data.*` (renamed in v0.23+)

## JavaScript Event Hooks

### Critical Concepts

**Hook files:**
- Create `*.pb.js` files in `pb_hooks/` directory
- Files auto-reload on save (Unix systems only)
- Use `/// <reference path="../pb_data/types.d.ts" />` for typing

**Hook execution chain:**
- ALL handlers must call `e.next()` to continue chain
- Throwing error OR not calling `e.next()` stops execution
- Hooks share signature: `function(e) {}`

### Hook Categories & Timing

See [references/hook_guide.md](references/hook_guide.md) for comprehensive hook reference.

**Model hooks vs Request hooks:**
- **Model hooks** (`onRecordCreate`, etc.) - No request context, triggered by ANY save/delete (API, hooks, console)
- **Request hooks** (`onRecordCreateRequest`, etc.) - Have request context, only trigger from API calls

**Hook timing for operations:**
```
BEFORE e.next() → before validation & DB operation
AFTER e.next() → after validation & DB operation (may not be persisted yet)
*AfterSuccess → after confirmed DB persistence
*AfterError → after DB operation failure
```

### Common Hook Pitfalls

**Problem: Hook doesn't trigger**
- Using wrong hook type (Request vs Model)
- Collection name filter is case-sensitive and must match exactly
- Hook file not saved as `*.pb.js`
- Syntax error preventing hook registration

**Problem: Infinite recursion**
- Calling `$app.dao().saveRecord()` inside update hook without preventing re-trigger
- **JavaScript Solution**: Use conditional guards to prevent re-execution
- **NEVER use `$app.unsafeWithoutHooks()`** - bypasses ALL validations including system checks
- Better approach: Check if processing already done before modifying

```javascript
// ❌ DANGEROUS - Bypasses system validations
onRecordUpdate((e) => {
    e.next()
    $app.unsafeWithoutHooks().save(e.record)  // UNSAFE!
}, "tasks")

// ✅ CORRECT - Use conditional guard
onRecordUpdate((e) => {
    if (e.record.get("processed") === true) {
        e.next()
        return
    }
    e.record.set("processed", true)
    e.next()
}, "tasks")

// ✅ ACCEPTABLE - Update different collection without hooks
onRecordAfterUpdateSuccess((e) => {
    const related = $app.dao().findRecordById("other", e.record.get("relatedId"))
    related.set("count", related.get("count") + 1)
    $app.dao().withoutHooks().saveRecord(related)  // OK for related records
    e.next()
}, "tasks")
```

**Problem: Changes in hook not reflected**
- Modifying record AFTER `e.next()` in Request hooks won't affect response
- Solution: Make changes BEFORE `e.next()` or use Model hooks

**Problem: Cascading hooks don't fire**
- When updating Record A inside Record B's hook, Record A's hooks don't trigger
- Solution: Use `e.dao.saveRecord()` (not `e.dao.withoutHooks()`) if you want cascading

### Hook Patterns

See [references/hook_patterns.md](references/hook_patterns.md) for specific examples.

**Common patterns:**
- Auto-populate fields on create
- Validate complex business logic
- Send notifications on changes
- Update related records
- Prevent certain field modifications

## Accessing Record Data

**In hooks:**
```javascript
// Get current value
const value = e.record.get("fieldName")

// Set value
e.record.set("fieldName", newValue)

// Get original (before changes)
const original = e.record.originalCopy()

// Parse to plain object for comparison
const parsed = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(e.record))
```

**In API rules:**
```
// Current record field
fieldName = "value"

// Submitted request data
@request.body.fieldName = "value"

// Auth user field
@request.auth.fieldName = "value"

// Related record via relation field
relationField.otherField = "value"
```

## Realtime Subscriptions & Security

### How Realtime Respects API Rules

**Critical understanding**: Realtime subscriptions enforce API rules automatically.

- **Single record subscription** → Uses collection's `viewRule`
- **Collection subscription** → Uses collection's `listRule`

```javascript
// Client subscribes to collection
pb.collection('posts').subscribe('*', (data) => {
    console.log(data.action, data.record)
})
// User only receives events for records they can LIST per listRule
```

### No Client-Side Filtering

**Important**: You CANNOT filter subscriptions client-side for security.

```javascript
// ❌ This filter parameter is IGNORED by PocketBase
pb.collection('posts').subscribe('*', {
    filter: 'status="draft"'  // Does nothing!
})

// ✅ Filter via API rules instead
// In collection's listRule:
status = "published" || @request.auth.id = author
```

### Security Implications

- Users only receive realtime events for records matching their `listRule`/`viewRule`
- Records becoming inaccessible don't emit "removed" events (performance)
- Check `@request.context = "realtime"` in rules if you need realtime-specific logic
- Realtime is secure by default - respects same permissions as REST API
