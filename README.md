# PocketBase Skill for Claude

A comprehensive skill for Claude that provides expert guidance on PocketBase backend development, with specialized focus on API rules (permissions) and JavaScript event hooks.

## Overview

This skill helps Claude (and Claude Code) correctly implement PocketBase permissions and hooks - two areas where LLMs commonly struggle due to their nuanced behavior and gotchas.

## Version Compatibility

This skill is current for **PocketBase v0.23 and later** (including v0.30.x, v0.31.x as of January 2025).

### Major Breaking Changes in v0.23.0

PocketBase v0.23.0 introduced significant breaking changes:
- **API Rules**: `@request.data.*` renamed to `@request.body.*`
- **Router**: Echo replaced with Go 1.22 net/http mux
- **File Uploads**: Changed from append to replace behavior for multi-file fields
- **Architecture**: DAO package merged into core.App

**Upgrading from <v0.23?** See official migration guides:
- JSVM (hooks): https://pocketbase.io/v023upgrade/jsvm/
- Go: https://pocketbase.io/v023upgrade/go/

### Version History
- **v0.31.x** (Latest - January 2025): Current stable release
- **v0.30.x**: Security improvements, relation filtering restrictions
- **v0.23.0** (2024): Major breaking changes, new architecture
- **<v0.23**: Legacy versions (not covered by this skill)

## Key Features

### Permissions (API Rules)

- **Clear mental models**: Rules act as BOTH authorization AND filters
- **Return code behavior**: Why you get 200/400/404/403 in different scenarios
- **Common patterns**: Owner-only, role-based, relationship-based access
- **Debugging tips**: What to check when rules don't work

### Hooks

- **Hook timing**: When exactly each hook fires in the execution chain
- **Model vs Request**: Which to use and why
- **Common pitfalls solved**:
  - Infinite recursion prevention
  - Hooks not triggering (collection names, file extensions)
  - Changes not persisting (before/after e.next())
  - Cascading updates (when to use withoutHooks())

## Why This Skill Exists

PocketBase's permission system and hooks have subtle behaviors that are hard for LLMs to get right:

1. **Rules are filters**: Failed listRule returns empty array, not error
2. **Superusers bypass rules**: Testing as admin masks permission bugs
3. **Hook timing matters**: Before vs after e.next() affects what persists
4. **Model vs Request hooks**: Easy to use wrong type and wonder why it doesn't fire
5. **Infinite loops**: Updating records in hooks without proper guards
6. **Production security gaps**: Default settings expose credentials as plaintext
7. **File upload validation**: Special modifiers don't work with files
8. **Realtime filtering**: Client-side filters are ignored for security

This skill codifies the knowledge from:
- Official PocketBase documentation (v0.23+)
- GitHub discussions and issues
- Common mistakes in real-world usage
- Production security best practices

## Usage Examples

**Setting permissions:**
```
"Create API rules so users can only edit their own posts but anyone can read them"
```

**Implementing hooks:**
```
"Create a hook that sends an email when a post's status changes to 'approved'"
```

**Debugging:**
```
"Why isn't my onRecordUpdate hook firing when I update records via the API?"
```

**Complex scenarios:**
```
"Set up a task management system with proper permissions and hooks for auto-updating counts"
```
